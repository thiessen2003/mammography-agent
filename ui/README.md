### **Image Analysis Testing**
- Upload mammography images (JPG, PNG, BMP, TIFF)
- Test with and without images
- Verify image processing capabilities

## üîç Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

#### **Import Errors**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd /path/to/mammography-agent
python ui/patient_simulator.py
```

#### **Connection Failures**
- Verify your OpenAI API key is correct
- Check internet connection
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

#### **Testing Your Setup**
Before running the full application, test your connection:
```bash
python ui/test_connection.py
```

This will verify:
- All module imports work correctly
- Your OpenAI API key is valid
- The Orchestrator can be created successfully

#### **Image Analysis Issues**
- Verify image file format is supported
- Check file permissions
- Ensure image file is not corrupted

### **Debug Information**
- Check the status text area for detailed logs
- Review error messages in popup dialogs
- Use the Settings tab to verify system information

## üé® Customization

### **Adding New Sample Queries**
Edit the `sample_queries` list in `create_patient_input_tab()` method:

```python
sample_queries = [
    "Your new query here",
    "Another sample case",
    # ... existing queries
]
```

### **Modifying UI Styles**
Update the `setup_styles()` method to change colors, fonts, and appearance.

### **Adding New Tabs**
Extend the `create_main_content()` method to add additional functionality.
